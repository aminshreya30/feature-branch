Traditional drawer sliders consist of two pieces of metal, one attached to the drawer and the
other to the furniture frame. When the two pieces are placed together, they allow the drawer to
slide in and out of the furniture frame. Traditional drawer sliders are simple and reliable, and they
have been used for decades in all kinds of furniture.
